# WE ARE WORKING WITH FRONTEND

1. HTML / javascript

later on Netxjs / Reactjs

```
------- WITH ALL THIS TOGETHER WE CAN SEND ANY TRANSACCION ------

// All we need to interact with our smart contract in frontend
1. PROVIDER / connection with the blockchain (infura, alquemy, etc)
2. SIGNER / wallet / someone with some gas
3. CONTRACT THAT WE ARE INTERCTING WITH
4. ABI & ADDRESS
```

## WE'RE GOING TO INTERACT WITH `ES6` IN THE BROWSER

1. Lets go into the _[ethers docs](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/#getting-started--importing--web-browser)_

2. It is generally better practice (for security reasons) to copy the _[`ethers library`](https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.6.esm.min.js)_ to your own webserver and serve it yourself.

3. We have to create a new file in our project, and we called `ethers-5.6.esm.min.js`.

4. Then we`re going to copy and paste in our file `ethers-5.6.esm.min.js` all the _[Library](https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.6.esm.min.js)_
